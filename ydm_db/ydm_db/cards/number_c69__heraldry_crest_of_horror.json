If this card has \"Number 69: Heraldry Crest\" as an Xyz Material, it gains this effect.\n? Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card, then target 1 face-up Xyz Monster your opponent controls; this card gains ATK equal to that face-up monster\u0027s original ATK, and if it gains ATK this way, this card\u0027s name becomes that monster\u0027s, and it gains that monster\u0027s original effect. These effects last until the End Phase.",
