Once per turn, if a Dinosaur-Type monster is Normal or Special Summoned (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon 1 \"Jurraegg Token\" (Dinosaur-Type/EARTH/Level 1/ATK 0/DEF 0) to your opponent\u0027s field in Defense Position. While your opponent controls a Token, they cannot target monsters on the field with card effects, except Tokens. Once per turn, if a Normal Monster(s) on the field would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can destroy that many Dinosaur-Type monsters in your hand and/or Deck instead.",
