Monsters your opponent controls cannot target face-up Beast-Warrior-Type monsters you control for attacks, except the Beast-Warrior-Type monster you control with the highest ATK (either, if tied). Once per turn, if a \"Zoodiac\" monster(s) you control would be destroyed by card effect, you can destroy 1 monster in your hand or field instead of 1 \"Zoodiac\" monster.",
