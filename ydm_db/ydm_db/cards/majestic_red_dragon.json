After damage calculation, if this card attacks: Destroy all Defense Position monsters on the field. Once per turn: You can target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; negate its effects, and if you do, this card gains ATK equal to that monster\u0027s ATK. These changes last until the end of this turn. During the End Phase: Target 1 \"Red Dragon Archfiend\" in your Graveyard; return this card from the field to the Extra Deck, then Special Summon that target.",
