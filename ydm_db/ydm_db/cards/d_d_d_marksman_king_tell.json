(Xyz Materials attached to that monster also become Xyz Materials on this card.) Once per turn, during either player\u0027s turn, if you took any effect damage this turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card, then target 1 face-up monster on the field; it loses 1000 ATK and DEF, and if it does, inflict 1000 damage to your opponent. If this card is sent from the field to the Graveyard: You can send 1 \"D/D\" or \"Dark Contract\" card from your Deck to the Graveyard.",
