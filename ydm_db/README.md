# YDM2-DB
This is the official database for the Ygo Dueling Mod for Minecraft. It contains card files, set files and distribution files (no images, just json files!). Fell free to fork this repo to make your own database.
## Important Notice
The "ydm_db" folder automatically gets deleted entirely whenever a new database is downloaded. Do not leave any files in there!
